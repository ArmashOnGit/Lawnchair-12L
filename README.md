**NOTE:** This only works on devices running A12L Lineage/AOSP ROM's. I can't say anything about other OEM skin's


Just a simple Magisk Module to replace the Boring Trebuchet Launcher with Lawnchair 12. Based on Launcher3 from Android 12.1, Lawnchair 12 provides a Pixel Launcher like Experience with the added bonus of Customization! We're also using Lawnicon's by Teamfiles to have more Themed Icons. Just flash the module and enjoy!

## Prerequisites:
- Compatible ROMs (**AOSP-based custom ROMs** or **Google Pixel stock ROM**) based on Android 12.
- Device rooted by [Magisk latest stable](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases/latest).
> It is strongly advised to only use the official version of Magisk (https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk)

**Disclaimer**
- I **WON'T** be responsible if anything happens with your device. Bootloops are not expected, but be prepared for the worst.



## Installation:
- Uninstall any other launcher if you're using one. Only keep the default launcher
- Download the module installation file from [Download Links](https://github.com/ArmashOnGit/Lawnchair-12L/tags) available
- Flash the file in Magisk and select your desired modifications using volume keys
- Reboot your device and go to **Settings** > **Apps** > **Default apps** > **Home app** and make sure **Lawnchair** is selected as your default launcher
